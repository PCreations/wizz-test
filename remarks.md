- tests not runnable if the server is already running : need to change port
- response API flat, warning, should be encapsulated in an object, not returning an array directly
- tests not independant
- needs pagination
- Badly encoded S3 JSON
- I assume we are only interested in the first entry for each top-level entry in json.
